# later imports processing, whose page-understanding chain imports
# dictionary_page_layout_policy; installing only in launcher.py is therefore too
# late for GUI/EXE/spawn processes.  The installer is narrow and only changes
# pages explicitly marked fallback=character_height.

# oversized candidate from evidence strong enough to manufacture a new entry.
