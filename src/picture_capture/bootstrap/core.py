"""Shared non-GUI composition profile for Picture Capture.

Bare ``import picture_capture`` is intentionally runtime-inert. GUI startup,
spawn workers, CLI entrypoints and application-level test/diagnostic harnesses
enter through this module when they need the composed project/detection runtime.
The remaining historical installer order stays explicit here until later phases
replace those compatibility seams with native service implementations.
