    # and policy imports no longer depend on a local installer ordering guard.

    # The GUI Layout overlay also needs the same physical-indent runtime before
    # app import. Ordinary detection itself prepares this runtime again
    # idempotently in every process, including spawn workers. The public Page

    # whenever an explicit capture_layout_rows(...) context is active. GUI
    # bootstrap no longer wraps understand_layout_core for this side effect.

    # Project Profile UI extensions are composed statically in
    # profile_wizard. app.py imports that finished class directly, so

    # controls the wizard's import order.

    # v2 base -> v3 corrections -> shared Page Understanding. GUI startup no
    # longer mutates training_export globals or controls exporter import order.

    # unlined_line_export.export_unlined_page_job; no GUI-time worker mutation
    # is required.
