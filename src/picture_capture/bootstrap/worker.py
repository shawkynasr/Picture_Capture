"""Explicit composition root for multiprocessing detection workers.

Shared process-wide runtime preparation is resolved through
``build_core_services``. LayoutRows capture is an explicit worker service;
Layout Core publishes into that context statically instead of requiring a
worker-local wrapper. The pickleable spawn job therefore consumes one worker
profile without reconstructing import-order-sensitive dependencies. Bare package
import performs no runtime installation.
