"""Explicit composition root for multiprocessing detection workers.

Shared process-wide runtime preparation is resolved through
``build_core_services`` before worker-specific LayoutRows extensions are added.
The pickleable spawn job therefore consumes one worker profile rather than
reconstructing import-order-sensitive dependencies itself. Bare package import
performs no runtime installation.
