"""Static application-facing PDIC I/O composition.

Core composition may wrap ``formats.read_pdic`` and ``formats.write_pdic`` with
classification sidecar persistence. The GUI additionally captures the first
automatic PDIC result as a training baseline. Resolve the core-owned callables
at call time so application imports do not depend on bootstrap mutating
``formats`` before ``app.py`` imports them by value.
