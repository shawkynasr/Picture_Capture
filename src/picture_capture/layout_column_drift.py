"""Preserve physical indents when a scanned column drifts across Y.

Project/Profile geometry owns the *semantic* column-left boundary.  Real scans,
however, can lean or curve slightly so lower rows may extend left of that fixed
boundary.  The historical Page Layout strip started exactly at ``column.left``;
once a row crossed that edge its leading ink was clipped and ``first_x`` became
0.  A later slant correction cannot recover pixels that were never observed.

This helper keeps the configured column geometry unchanged but re-measures each
recovered row in a wider analysis window that extends to the left.  The measured
``first_x`` remains expressed relative to the original semantic ``column.left``
and is therefore allowed to be negative before common-drift normalization.

Important ownership rule: this module owns *indent remeasurement only*.  It must
never replace the universal large-head detector.  Large-head detection has its
own stricter row-front/oversized authorization runtime; replacing that callable
here used to silently disable those guards in the real GUI/spawn import order.
The helper ``_analysis_left_for_column`` remains public so the strict large-head
detector can reuse exactly the same left safety band without changing ownership.
