"""OCR-assisted headword-boundary consumer.

OCR recognition is a shared channel (:mod:`picture_capture.ocr_channel`). This
module is the *consumer* that borrows those OCR sources to infer dictionary
headword boundaries. Keeping the consumer separate is important: running OCR
on existing markers must not implicitly run, depend on, or mutate boundary
placement logic.

The mature parser/arbitration implementation still lives behind
``evidence_fusion.detect_paddle_headwords``. Historical ``paddle_*`` setting
translation and the temporary parser-runner bridge are both isolated in
:mod:`picture_capture.ocr_channel_legacy`; this consumer therefore depends only
on the shared OCR-channel contract plus the stable parser backend.

    OCR engine selection and invocation belong to the channel. This consumer

    mature OCR drawing pipeline; the compatibility seam keeps legacy settings,
    records, and runner call sites out of this module.

    ``engine`` is retained solely for the historical public
    ``detect_paddle_headwords(..., engine=...)`` test/integration seam. An

    forwarded to the mature backend exactly as before; normal application calls
    leave it ``None`` and use the canonical shared OCR channel.
