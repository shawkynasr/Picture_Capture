"""Compatibility facade for OCR-assisted headword detection.

The reusable OCR engine selection/execution channel lives in
:mod:`picture_capture.ocr_channel`.  OCR-assisted separator generation is a
separate consumer in :mod:`picture_capture.ocr_boundary_detection`.

The stable parser/evidence implementation remains in
:mod:`picture_capture.paddle_headwords_core`; training-export-driven decision
refinements remain in :mod:`picture_capture.evidence_fusion`; separator-Y
refinement is shared by Layout, OCR, and existing-PDIC workflows in
:mod:`picture_capture.separator_y_refinement`.

This historical module path remains the public/runtime import surface so older
plugins, tests and user tooling keep working unchanged.
