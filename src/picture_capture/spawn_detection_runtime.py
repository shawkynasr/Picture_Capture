"""Spawn-safe ordinary drawing worker with the same runtime metadata as the GUI.

The main launcher installs Entry classification by wrapping both Layout-row
materialization and PDIC IO.  A ``multiprocessing`` worker started with the
``spawn`` context imports ``picture_capture.processing`` directly and does not
run the GUI launcher, so those process-local wrappers are otherwise absent.

That mismatch is especially dangerous when ordinary drawing replaces an existing
PDIC: the old EntryClassification sidecar can survive while the marker geometry
changes, and the GUI may later match stale regular/oversized/manual metadata onto
the newly detected markers.

This top-level function is intentionally pickleable.  It bootstraps the same
classification runtime inside each spawned worker before detection and writes the
new PDIC through the classification-aware formats writer.  It also captures the
physical Layout rows used by ordinary drawing into ``data/LayoutRows`` so later
post-production QA can reuse them without re-running full Layout analysis.
