"""Physical-row resolver dedicated to unlined-row QA.

This module is intentionally narrower than PageUnderstanding/Layout Core.  It
never needs entry/body roles, sampled symbols or universal large-head evidence.
Only the final escalation step may invoke the reliable per-page geometry
detector (including Paddle when configured/needed), and even then it stops at
the physical Page Layout policy result.
